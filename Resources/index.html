			<p>What if I were to tell you that there was a power source 
			that is 80% cleaner than gasoline? What if I were to further 
			tell you that this incredible power source was also cheaper 
			per gallon? What if I were to stretch your imagination beyond 
			what you thought was possible and I said that this power 
			source was able to be mostly produced here in America? I 
			imagine that you would think that it’s simply not possible. 
			That would be an incredible world wouldn’t it? Well, this 
			isn’t some exotic new particle we’re talking about, or even 
			some sort of futuristic science fiction. This fuel is here 
			and available today. It’s called propane.</p>
			<p>You mean like I use in my grill? Yes, the very same 
			propane that you use to power your grill can also be used to 
			power your weed whacker, lawn mower, golf cart, rototiller, 
			and just about anything else with a small engine. Sure, 
			you’re probably thinking to yourself, but I bet it costs a 
			fortune to buy devices like that. Yes, it does. That’s why 
			a bunch of guys got together and figured out how to convert 
			your gas guzzling, air polluting, old piece of machinery and 
			make it more powerful, completely green, and cheaper 
			to run.</p>
			<p>As if that weren’t enough to pique your interest, this 
			conversion can be done in as little as a half hour on average 
			and doesn’t cost more than a typical repair to the same 
			equipment would.</p>
			<p>Alright, so what’s the downside? That’s the beauty of all 
			of this. There is no down side. You will be paying 30 – 40% 
			less money for the same functionality, and you get all the 
			fun of being morally superior by using greener lawn 
			equipment.</p>
			<p>Here is a non-exclusive list of some of the things 
			we’ve seen converted:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Back Pack Blowers</li>
				<li>Commercial Blowers</li>
				<li>Ditch Witcher</li>
				<li>Generators</li>
				<li>Outboard Motors</li>
				<li>Lawnmowers (both commercial and domestic</li>
				<li>Snow Blowers</li>
				<li>Water Pumps</li>
				<li>Weed Trimmers</li>
				<li>and much more...</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you are still teetering on the brink of indecision, 
			how about the fact that the United States has the highest 
			concentrations of propane in the world and more than 90% 
			of the propane used is from here? The manufacture of all 
			AltFuel propane power kits is done here in the United States 
			as well.</p>
